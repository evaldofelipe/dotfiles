## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. 

This config uses [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). If you want to change your shell to zsh, [install it](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) and run ``chsh -s $(which zsh)``.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielkoerich/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source sync.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source sync.sh
```
